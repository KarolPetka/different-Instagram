This is the pinnacle of social media, here we can give others well deserved ~~~hate~~ constructive criticism.
 1. Given comments under user content.
 2. Delete comment *not* button, bin button image became offensive lateley that is why we opted for safe option which is "*DELETE*" text that on click removes you comment.
 3. Comment input field where you can write somebody their well deserved ~~~hate~~ constructive criticism.
 4. Post button, following user friendly approche we can not add comment on Enter key press, we have to click on "Post".
 - **User profile**:
![user](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60034422/209863154-05a0fb3c-8928-4a94-8fbe-9b16f923b647.png)
Universal user profile that have all a person needs to show off on social media.
 1. User profile icon, displaying user profile.
 2. User information containg all neccessery information.
 3. User profile image.
 4. Edit button that allows user to edit information on profile and profile image.
 5. Save button that allows to save changes to profile.
 - **Add content**:
 ![add](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60034422/209865995-858272cb-96f4-4ef8-b399-282564bcc222.png)
Here is what everyone wants, adding content so that everyone else can see and envy your life
 1. Add icon, on click we get form to input content.
 2. Place for images.
 3. Place for text.
 4. Add button that on clicks adds your original content that everyone is dying to see, again Enter key is deprecated here.
 - **User search**:
 ![userid](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60034422/209868286-6a8f23b4-d679-4188-94fc-9603a2a786a9.png)
Here is what stalkers love the most, all we need to do to find user is to input userId-#, by # we need to input ID of user we are searching for, AND Enter works here like butter.
 - **Photo search**:
![photoid](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60034422/209868428-b3bf1c9e-b325-4214-9e67-75823de5ce73.png)
If we want to search for specific post all we need to do is use our user friendly search and input photoId-#, instead of # we just put desired content ID, again Enter works smooth here.
 - **Album search**:
![albumid](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60034422/209869826-72a2dbbc-27ef-4bb6-a55c-01cd6a790da0.png)
For our album search what we need to do is to serch albumId-#, select desired album ID in place of #, also Enter key works as IBM intended. <br />
*^ofcourse "hacky" possiblities of our search are obvious but we are more then sure that this way is the future and what people want, and our users need to remember that any break attempt will get user put on Santa naughty list.*
